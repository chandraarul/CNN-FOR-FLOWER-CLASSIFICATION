# CNN-FOR-FLOWER-CLASSIFICATION
This project aims to make a good use of CNN to classify the type of flower through uploaded image
## Dataset

This project uses a flower dataset with 3 classes:
- Daisy ðŸŒ¼
- Dandelion ðŸŒ»
- Rose ðŸŒ¹

The dataset is not included in this repository because of size and licensing reasons.

To run this project:
1. Prepare your dataset with the following folder structure:
flowers_data/
flowers/
daisy/
dandelion/
rose/
2. You can use any public flower dataset (for example: [Flowers Recognition on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/alxmamaev/flowers-recognition)) and keep only the `daisy`, `dandelion`, and `rose` folders.
3. Place the dataset in the correct directory before running the code.

The code was run on google colab
